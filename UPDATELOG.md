* Update 2.4.1: chi_set_next_items_no_format has been added. With this function, the formatting process will be ignored for the number entered. Note: Since the purpose of the chi_format function is to perform direct formatting, it cannot be ignored.
* Update 2.5.0: chi_snull fixed.
* Update 2.5.1: All replace functions fixed.
